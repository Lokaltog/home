# Lokaltog's sync repo

- Author: Kim Silkeb√¶kken (kim.silkebaekken+github@gmail.com)
- Source: <https://github.com/Lokaltog/sync>
- Version: **1.0.4**
- Updated: **2011-03-29**.

## Important notes

Most of the stuff in this repo depends on the fonts in `fonts/bdf` to 
look right. DWM requires `cureextra` for statusline icons while vim and 
zsh require `lokaltog-12` for icons and various symbols. Everything will 
work without these fonts, but it will look weird because the icons and 
symbols replace some Unicode glyphs.

Some binaries are targeted toward Arch Linux users (they use `pacman` to 
install missing packages).

If you just want to check out how everything looks without messing with 
your own home folder, just create a test user account and install 
everything from that account.

## Installation guide

### Step 1: Clone the repo and fetch submodules

	git clone git://github.com/Lokaltog/sync.git
	cd sync
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

### Step 2: Create symlinks to the dotfiles

There's a shell script in `sync/dotfiles` which will automatically 
create symlinks for all dotfiles in this repo.

	/bin/sh ~/sync/dotfiles/setup.sh ~

### Step 3 (optional, Arch Linux only): Compile and install dwm

	cd ~/sync/pkg/dwm-git
	makepkg -si

The `.xinitrc` in this repo executes `dwm`. Restart X, dwm should start 
without any problems.
